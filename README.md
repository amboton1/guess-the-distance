# Guess The Distance game

## What is this?
This repository is intendend for my junior colleagues with the goal of helping them gaining some experience in developing and deploying a full web app (backend and frontend).

## What we're going to build?
* We are going to build a simple game of guessing the distance (in kilometeres) between 2 random cities. 
* It will be a multiplayer game but in the beginning we will make a single player (practice mode).

## How is this structured?
This tasks are strucutred in phases so it is easier to follow and do code reviews.

As we progress through phases we will be introducing new steps with guidelines on what should be done next. You will be given instructions what needs to be done, what to use and some general guidelines, but how you're going to do it is up to you to figure it out. You need to struggle a little bit on your own before asking for help as it is the best way to learn.

I intentionally didn't plan everything upfront, because I want to leave the space for gradual improvements and introducing new stuff, depending on your feedback on difficulty level. 

## What are you going to learn by developing this?
You will be using various things oftenly used in JS app development process such as:
- React
- React Router
- Redux
- NodeJs / Express
- Sockets
- Testing
- Deployment
- ... and possibly more.

## Phases
* [Project setup](https://github.com/goran-zdjelar/guess-the-distance/tree/main/Tasks/0%20-%20Project%20setup)
* [Distance calculation](https://github.com/goran-zdjelar/guess-the-distance/tree/main/Tasks/01%20-%20Distance%20calculation)
* ... to be continued
